    > They propose `SparseGPT`, the first accurate one-shot pruning method which works efficiently at the scale of models with 10-100 billion parameters. `SparseGPT` works by reducing the pruning problem to an extremely large-scale instance of sparse regression. It is based on a new approximate sparse regression solver, used to solve a layer-wise compression problem, which is efficient enough to execute in a few hours on the largest openly-available GPT models (175B parameters), using a single GPU. At the same time, SparseGPT is accurate enough to drop negligible accuracy post-pruning, without any fine-tuning.

### Offloading

Recent years have witnessed the emergence of systems that are specialized for LLM inference, such as FasterTransformer (NVIDIA, 2022), PaLM inference (Pope et al., 2022), Deepspeed-Inference (Aminabadi et al., 2022), Accelerate (HuggingFace, 2022), LightSeq (Wang et al., 2021), TurboTransformers (Fang et al., 2021).

To enable LLM inference on easily accessible hardware, offloading is an essential technique — to our knowledge, among current systems, only Deepspeed-Inference and Huggingface Accelerate include such functionality.

### Parallelism

Compression methods for model acceleration (i.e., model parallelism) papers:

- [Does compressing activations help model parallel training? (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02654) - They presents the first empirical study on the effectiveness of compression algorithms (pruning-based, learning-based, and quantization-based - using a Transformer architecture) to improve the communication speed of model parallelism. **Summary:** 1) activation compression not equal to gradient compression; 2) training setups matter a lot; 3) don't compress early layers' activation.

Currently supported PEFT methods: LoRA, prefix tuning, prompt tuning, and P-Tuning (which employs trainable continuous prompt embeddings). They'll be exploring more PEFT methods, such as (IA)3 and bottleneck adapters.
